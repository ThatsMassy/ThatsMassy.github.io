Description: Requires iOS 6 (maybe compatible below)

A very basic app downgrade tool implementation. I wrote this because I could not wait for unlimapps to update their App Admin tool for iOS 6 (which might never happen, anyways...). As I said, just the very basics: Downgrade an app if you have a workig "external version identifier". Not hiding updates, no fancy UI, complicated interface.
Notice: As of V.0.2, there is no preference panel anymore. Adowngrader will prompt you with a text input where you are allowed to change the downloading app identifier.

How to use
1) Find out the "external version identifier" of the version of the app you want to downgrade.
2) Download your app as usual (one at a time).
3) Paste your external version identifier into the text prompt (Adowngrader might prompt you more than once).
4) Important: *Wait* for the download to finish!
5) Start your app :)

Spelling
"A" like the french "un" (one/a) and "downgrader" like the english word "downgrade" with an appended "-er", like in "murderer". Short "A" and stress the "do", then "wngrader" spoken out slowly. I have no idea why I spent one thought on this.
New in Version 0.2-7
- The "Who else needs a preference pane?" update.
- Now with an innovative enable/disable toggle.
- Funny app icon included.
New in Version 0.2
- The "Who needs a preference pane?" update.
- Easier to use now, a bit more lightweight.
- Thanks to /u/7bubbl3s for praising this tool that much.
